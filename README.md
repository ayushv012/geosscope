GeoScope -- Interactive 3D Globe Explorer & Geography Quiz
GeoScope is an interactive 3D globe web application that combines world exploration, real-time geopolitical awareness, and geography quizzes into a single polished experience. Built as a lightweight static site with vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript and the globe.gl library, it runs entirely in the browser with zero backend.
Explore
Spin a fully interactive 3D globe with smooth auto-rotation, zoom, and pan. Hover over any of 200+ countries to preview facts, or click to pin and fly to it. Each country reveals a detailed info panel with its flag, capital, population (with a world-share percentage bar), area, languages, currency, GDP, and a hand-curated fun fact. Search instantly with keyboard navigation, or hit Random to discover somewhere new.
Learn
A built-in Conflict Zones layer highlights 24 countries in active conflict, color-coded by severity (high/medium/low). Toggle it on to see the geopolitical landscape at a glance, with each country's panel showing conflict type, involved parties, and background context.
Play
Four free Geography Quiz modes test your knowledge in different ways:
Identify Countries -- the globe flies to a mystery country; pick from 4 options
Name the Capital -- given a country, choose the correct capital
Continent Quiz -- place countries on the right continent
Population Pick -- spot the most populated country from a set of four
Each quiz features a 15-second timer, point scoring with time bonuses, streak multipliers, and a results breakdown. High scores persist across sessions. Two additional PRO modes (Flag Challenge, Speed Run) are teased for future premium release.
Achieve
An 18-badge achievement system rewards exploration and quiz performance -- from "First Steps" for visiting your first country, to continent-specific badges like "African Safari" and "Silk Road," to quiz feats like "Perfect Score" and "Unstoppable" (10-answer streak). Toast notifications celebrate each unlock. Three exclusive PRO badges are visible as aspirational goals.
Compare
Pin any country and use the Compare tool to search for a second country and see them side-by-side with proportional animated bars for population, area, and GDP.
