GeoScope is an interactive 3D globe web application that lets users explore the world's countries through an immersive, browser-based experience. Built with vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript and the globe.gl library, it renders a fully rotatable 3D globe where users can hover, click, search, and fly to any of ~203 countries. Each country reveals a rich detail panel with its flag, capital, population (with a world-share bar), area, languages, currency, GDP, and a hand-curated fun fact.


Key features include:
- 3D interactive globe with smooth auto-rotation, zoom, and pan
- Hover-to-preview and click-to-pin country selection mechanics
- Instant search with keyboard navigation (/ to focus, arrow keys, Enter)
- Random country discovery button
- Dark and beige themes with a polished, monospace/developer-aesthetic UI (JetBrains Mono)
- HUD overlay displaying real-time latitude, longitude, and altitude
- Exploration tracker counting how many countries a user has visited in a session
- Keyboard shortcuts throughout (/, R, T, Esc)
- Zero dependencies beyond globe.gl -- fully static, no backend required
